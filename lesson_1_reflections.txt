How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Diff between version without bug and version with bug shows changed text and one of this change include bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

This information gives opportunity to find bugs or restore early version of program

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

With manual choose we can create a logically separated commit, but can forget to create and lose program code. With automatically save version may be unlogical, but we don't lose program code.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because different files may be interrelated and more sense to commit them together. But it make sense not in all cases.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

First I use git log to show the all commits ant then I use git diff to show particular changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Because I have an opportunity to return previous variant of code without error.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to try using Git for studying.
