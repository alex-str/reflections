When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I would use several devices for development, or then another developer works on the same project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is a copying of another repository on the gitHub. Clone uses in the local computer. Branch is the part of repository.
Fork uses on GitHub. Clone uses on local computer. Branch can be use in both places.
